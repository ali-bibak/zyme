The `zyme auth` command helps manage authentication with the Zyme CLI. You can register, log in, and log out using these subcommands.

## Commands

### `zyme auth register`

This command allows you to create a new account with Zyme:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
zyme auth register
</CodeBlock>

After registration, you'll be able to log in and start using Zyme.

### `zyme auth login`

This command allows you to log in to your Zyme account:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
zyme auth login
</CodeBlock>

Once logged in, you will be able to use all features associated with your account.

### `zyme auth logout`

This command logs you out of your Zyme account:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
zyme auth logout
</CodeBlock>

This is useful if you're switching accounts or no longer need access to your current account on this machine.
