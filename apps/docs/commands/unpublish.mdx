The `zyme unpublish` command allows you to remove a previously published project or plugin from the Zyme ecosystem, making it unavailable for download or use. This command is useful when you need to retract a project due to issues or when itâ€™s no longer needed.

## Commands

### `zyme unpublish <project-name>`

This command unpublishes the specified project or plugin:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`zyme unpublish <project-name>`}
</CodeBlock>

For example, to unpublish a plugin named `zyme-analytics`:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
zyme unpublish zyme-analytics
</CodeBlock>

This command will remove the project from the registry or platform where it was published.

### `zyme unpublish --force`

Use the `--force` flag to forcefully unpublish a project, bypassing any confirmations:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`zyme unpublish <project-name> --force`}
</CodeBlock>

This option is useful when you need to unpublish quickly without manual intervention.

### `zyme unpublish --dry-run`

The `--dry-run` option allows you to simulate the unpublish process without actually removing the project:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`zyme unpublish <project-name> --dry-run`}
</CodeBlock>

This is helpful if you want to ensure that everything is configured properly before performing the actual unpublish.
