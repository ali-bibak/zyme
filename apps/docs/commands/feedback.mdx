The `zyme feedback` command allows users to provide feedback about their experience with the Zyme CLI, making it easier for developers to submit suggestions or report issues.

## Commands

### `zyme feedback submit`

This command lets users submit feedback directly from the CLI:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
zyme feedback submit
</CodeBlock>

After running the command, users will be prompted to enter their feedback, which is then sent to the Zyme team for review.

### `zyme feedback status`

This command allows users to check the status of previously submitted feedback:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
zyme feedback status
</CodeBlock>

This will display whether the feedback is under review, resolved, or if further action is needed.
