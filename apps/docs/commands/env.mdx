The `zyme env` command helps you manage and view environment variables for your project, ensuring consistent configuration across different environments.

## Commands

### `zyme env list`

This command lists all environment variables currently set in your project:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
zyme env list
</CodeBlock>

This provides visibility into the environment variables used, helping you ensure that the right values are set for development, testing, and production.

### `zyme env set <key> <value>`

This command sets a new environment variable or updates an existing one:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`zyme env set <key> <value>`}
</CodeBlock>

For example, to set a new API key:
<CodeBlock language="bash">
zyme env set API_KEY "your_api_key"
</CodeBlock>

### `zyme env unset <key>`

This command removes an environment variable from your project:

<CodeBlock language="bash">

{`zyme env unset <key>`}
</CodeBlock>

For example, to remove an API key:
<CodeBlock language="bash">
zyme env unset API_KEY
</CodeBlock>
