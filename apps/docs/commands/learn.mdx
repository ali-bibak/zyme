The `zyme learn` command provides access to learning resources, tutorials, and guides directly from the CLI, making it easy for developers to enhance their knowledge without leaving their terminal.

## Commands

### `zyme learn`

Users will be prompted to select a topic or guide from the list.

zyme learn state-management
</CodeBlock>
